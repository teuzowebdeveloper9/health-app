# Medical Appointment Booking App

## Overview

This React Native application is designed for booking medical appointments. It showcases a range of features and technologies, demonstrating significant learning and development progress.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- React Native Async Storage
- Java (Backend)
- Docker
- typescript
- axios

## Key Features

- User authentication (login and registration)
- Persistent user sessions
- Route protection based on authentication status
- User state management using React hooks (useEffect)

## Backend

The backend is entirely built with Java, utilizing Docker for containerization. It incorporates both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases for efficient data management.

## Learning Outcomes

This project has been an incredible learning experience, providing hands-on practice with:

- Full-stack development using React Native and Java
- Database management with both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) solutions
- State management in React Native applications
- Authentication flows and protected routing
- Docker containerization for backend services

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app is functional, there are plans for future improvements:

- Implement appointment booking functionality
- Create separate user types (doctors and patients)
- Expand backend capabilities to support new features

## Note

Development is currently paused due to other commitments, but work will resume to implement these exciting new features when time permits.
