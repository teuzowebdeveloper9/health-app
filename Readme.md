# Medical Appointment Booking App

## Overview

This React Native application is designed for booking medical appointments. It showcases a range of features and technologies, demonstrating significant learning and development progress.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- React Native Async Storage
- Java (Backend)
- Docker

## Key Features

- User authentication (login and registration)
- Persistent user sessions
- Route protection based on authentication status
- User state management using React hooks (useEffect)

## Backend

The backend is entirely built with Java, utilizing Docker for containerization. It incorporates both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases for efficient data management.

## Learning Outcomes

This project has been an incredible learning experience, providing hands-on practice with:

- Full-stack development using React Native and Java
- Database management with both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) solutions

- Implement appointment booking functionality
- Create separate user types (doctors and patients)
- Expand backend capabilities to support new features

## Note

Development is currently paused due to other commitments, but work will resume to implement these exciting new features when time permits.

## Conclusion

This project has been a valuable learning experience, combining frontend and backend technologies to create a practical medical appointment booking application. It serves as a solid foundation for future development and showcases a wide range of skills in modern web and mobile development.
